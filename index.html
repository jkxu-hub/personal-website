            <p class = "about-me"> 
                Hello! I am an aspiring software engineer based in the NYC Metropolitan area.
                <br><br>
                I graduated in January of 2024 with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the University at Buffalo (UB). 
            </p>

            <div class = "body-img" style="background-image: url(../images/ub-night.jpeg);"> </div>
 

            <p class = "about-me">
                My time at UB exposed me to many interesting ideas in computer science and software development.
                <br><br>
                I was most fascinated by classes that stripped down the layers of abstraction that the programmers before me had built, and forced me to build back up using the high level principles taught in the class and my own ingenuity.
                
            </p>

            <div class = "body-img" style="background-image: url(../images/motherboard.jpeg);"> </div>

            <p class = "about-me">
                What was so gratifying about classes like this is that it taught me that software isn’t magic and you really can build anything, if you are willing to dig deep enough. 
                <br><br>
                These classes tended to require building projects so large and <em>confusing</em> that no single programmer could do it alone, 
                
            </p>

            <p class = "about-me">
                which taught me that programming is a lot more fun when there are other people there to   <b>collaborate</b> with you. 
                <br><br>
                I'm excited to have many more great experiences like this on a professional level.
